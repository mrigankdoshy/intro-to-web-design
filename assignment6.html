      Did we originate from somewhere? How? Questions like these pop at the base of every
      human’s mind at some point of time. In an attempt to answer them, two factions emerged and
      have thenceforth been bellicose with each other; they are the creationist faction and the
      evolutionist faction. So, did we evolve or were we created? Here’s a glimpse at both the
      theories to answer the question.

        Evolutionism refers to the change amendment that occurs over time through which species
        revamp and diverge to produce multiple descendant species. Creationism, stridently, is a
        religious concept which says that God created the universe because it is within his strength and knowledge to do so. However, while evolutionism bestows various theories, creationism gives a singular explanation for how things came to be.

        How did the two factions come into the picture? After the introduction of the theory by Sir Charles Darwin about how things originated and man’s faith in God, which remained
        indubitable for centuries, had reeled. The community cleaved into evolutionists, who believed that life, universe and all that it contains developed from the primeval atom and other primitive organisms, and creationists, who kept believing life in all its diversity was created by a higher entity, God.

        Fossils tell us a lot about the past, but are they certain? Evolutionists often reason with the argument that fossil findings prove that organisms have evolved. According to the Bible, bones of such creatures as dinosaurs, or the remains of even more ancient beings found by archaeologists are much older than the age of our world. Therefore, evolutionists claim creationists are wrong. Creationists, however, justify their case by claiming that all the fossil findings are already completely formed, and appear to been unchanged much over time; that is, they are in a stasis condition (Geological Society of America, n.d.).

        So was it God that created the universe and all that it contains? Evolutionists—as well as
        atheists—state, despite the various scientific and technological discoveries inventions and despite having observed systems in the universe using orbital telescopes, there is still no factual evidence of God’s existence (Marshall Brain, n.d.). Creationists say that although God hasn’t been seen or heard, indirect evidences prove its existence. For example, evolutionists believe in survival of the fittest as a way to describe the process of natural selection. However creationists controverse this by circular reasoning: the fittest are those who survive, and those who survive are the fittest, determined by God. (John Rennie, 2002)

        Evolutionists believe that “before” the Big Bang, there existed nothing (although the question of “before” the Big Bang is inconsistent because time started when the Big Bang occurred) but after it, the matter organized itself in ordered structures, which become even more structured and organized as time increased and shaped out into stars, planets, chemicals, and finally cells with life. Surprisingly, creationists oppose this thesis using Science - According to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, everything tends to blend and mix with their environment over time, finally reaching the steady-state or point of equilibrium, which does not happen in nature. (Best Bible Science, n.d.)

        At the same instant, both sides seem to forget a point of view that does not necessarily
        contradict another one. It is possible God could have formulated everything, created
        certain elements and compounds for the universe’s process to grow, and then just
        pressed a metaphysical “Start” button, letting its ideas self-embody, watching the
        results. Or in other words, God could have created the life and then left this life to find itsown ways.

      <p>
        The clash between evolutionists and creationists seems to be far from a settling belief.
        Despite all of these, the conclusions of creationism, evolutionism and evolutionary
        creationism are still subjects that need to be completely proved and confirmed. Just as it
        cannot be proven that God created the universe out of nothing, it’s hard to show that the big bang and natural selection were facts that happened in the past. Hence it’s futile that we proceed to find which of the factions is correct. They both explain the universe’s origin and they both hold some verisimilitude. However, right now, I choose to believe the theory of Evolution supported with science. (Creation VS Evolution - Jamaican Label Art, n.d.)
