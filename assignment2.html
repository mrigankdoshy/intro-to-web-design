			<h2>Fractals</h2>
			<h3>September 11, 2020</h3>

			<p><img src="fractal.jpeg" width="500" height="333"/></p>
			<p>
				Fractals are one of the world’s most amazing mathematical concepts. They can be observed in nature and even within ourselves.

				Why does a river sometimes look like a tree that looks like a leaf? Why is a snowflake the way it is? “In the whole of science, the whole of mathematics, smoothness was everything. What I did was to open up roughness for investigation,” Mandelbrot said. Why? Cloud aren't perfect spheres and mountains aren't cones. There is some irregularity, some asymmetry in the universe.

				A fractal is a never-ending pattern. They are infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales. They are driven by recursion - repeating a simple process over and over again. Fractals are images of dynamic systems – the pictures of Chaos. 
			</p>

			<h4>Mandelbrot Set</h4>
			<p><img src="mandelbrot.jpg" width="500" height="333"/></p>
			<p>
				This fractal is named after mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot, who in 1975 first proposed the term “fractal”.

				Each of these crowns consists of similar "seahorse tails"; their number increases with powers of 2, a typical phenomenon in the environment of satellites. The unique path to the spiral center passes the satellite from the groove of the cardioid to the top of the "antenna" on the "head".

			<h2>Golden Ratio</h2>
			<h3>September 18, 2020</h3>

			<p><img src="pattern.jpeg" width="500" height="333"/></p>
			<p>
				A couple of centuries ago, some of the greatest minds started observing patterns in the beautiful nature around themselves; From the pattern of the florets of a flower, to the leaf arrangement in plants, the scales of a pineapple or the bracts of a pinecone; everything had the same pattern. And the arrangement goes 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 and so on. That's right, it's the Fibonacci sequence. When you start calculating ratio of fibonacci number with its previous fibonacci number, we end up with something like 1.61803... an irrational number.

				<p><img src="parthenon.png" width="500" height="333"/></p>

				The Golden Ratio describes the perfectly symmetrical relationship between two proportions. Approximately equal to a 1:1.618 ratio, the Golden Ratio can be illustrated using a Golden Rectangle. This is a rectangle where, if you cut off a square (side length equal to the shortest side of the rectangle), the rectangle that's left will have the same proportions as the original rectangle.

				<p><img src="rectangle.png" width="500" height="333"/></p>

				So if you remove the left-hand square from the rectangle above, you'll be left with another, smaller Golden Rectangle. This could continue infinitely. Similarly, adding a square equal to the length of the longest side of the rectangle gets you increasingly closer to a Golden Rectangle and the Golden Ratio.

				<p><img src="goldenratio.jpg" width="500" height="333"/></p>

				This relates to the Fibonacci Sequence (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...) , in which each term is the sum of the previous two. 

				<p><img src="goldenspiral.jpg" width="500" height="333"/></p>

				Plotting the relationships in scale provides us with what's know as a Golden Spiral. This occurs organically in the natural world. Mathematically golden ratio is an irrational number, which means we can never achieve it perfectly in design; a debate going on forever.

			<h2>The Creation of the Destroyer</h2>
			<h3>September 25, 2020</h3>

			<p>
				Have you ever wondered about the creation of a black hole? A black hole is, to put in layman terms, the death of a star. A star lives off its life emitting light in the form of solar radiation for about billions of years untill a time comes when the fuel finishes and the internal gravitational force of the star dominates causing it to shrink and increasing its density so much that it bends the space time. The trough in the space time is so huge that any object near it would sink and fall towards the black hole.

			<h2>Arrow of time</h2>
			<h3>October 2, 2020</h3>

			<p>
				I'm trying to understand how time works. And that's a huge question that has lots of different aspects to it. A lot of them go back to Einstein and spacetime and how we measure time using clocks. But the particular aspect of time that I'm interested in is the arrow of time: the fact that the past is different from the future. We remember the past but we don't remember the future. There are irreversible processes. There are things that happen, like you turn an egg into an omelet, but you can’t turn an omelet into an egg.


				And we sort of understand that halfway. The arrow of time is based on ideas that go back to Ludwig Boltzmann, an Austrian physicist in the 1870s. He figured out this thing called entropy. Entropy is just a measure of how disorderly things are. And it tends to grow. That's the second law of thermodynamics: Entropy goes up with time, things become more disorderly. So, if you neatly stack papers on your desk, and you walk away, you're not surprised they turn into a mess. You'd be very surprised if a mess turned into neatly stacked papers. That's entropy and the arrow of time. Entropy goes up as it becomes messier.


				So, Boltzmann understood that and he explained how entropy is related to the arrow of time. But there's a missing piece to his explanation, which is, why was the entropy ever low to begin with? Why were the papers neatly stacked in the universe? Basically, our observable universe begins around 13.7 billion years ago in a state of exquisite order, exquisitely low entropy. It's like the universe is a wind-up toy that has been sort of puttering along for the last 13.7 billion years and will eventually wind down to nothing. But why was it ever wound up in the first place? Why was it in such a weird low-entropy unusual state?

			<h2>Black Holes</h2>
			<h3>October 9, 2020</h3>

			<p>
				A black hole is a place in space where gravity pulls so much that even light can not get out. The gravity is so strong because matter has been squeezed into a tiny space. This can happen when a star is dying.


				Because no light can get out, people can't see black holes. They are invisible. Space telescopes with special tools can help find black holes. The special tools can see how stars that are very close to black holes act differently than other stars.

				<h4>How Big Are Black Holes?</h4>

				Black holes can be big or small. Scientists think the smallest black holes are as small as just one atom. These black holes are very tiny but have the mass of a large mountain. Mass is the amount of matter, or "stuff," in an object.


				Another kind of black hole is called "stellar." Its mass can be up to 20 times more than the mass of the sun. There may be many, many stellar mass black holes in Earth's galaxy. Earth's galaxy is called the Milky Way.


				The largest black holes are called "supermassive." These black holes have masses that are more than 1 million suns together. Scientists have found proof that every large galaxy contains a supermassive black hole at its center. The supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy is called Sagittarius A. It has a mass equal to about 4 million suns and would fit inside a very large ball that could hold a few million Earths.

			<h2>Matter</h2>
			<h3>October 16, 2020</h3>

			<p>
				Matter is the "stuff" that makes up the universe — everything that takes up space and has mass is matter. All matter is made up of atoms, which are in turn made up of protons, neutrons and electrons. Atoms come together to form molecules, which are the building blocks for all types of matter.

				<h4>The five phases of matter</h4>

				There are four natural states of matter: Solids, liquids, gases and plasma. The fifth state is the man-made Bose-Einstein condensates. Although, there are a lot more states of matter, these 5 are considered to be dominating.


				We all know what solids, liquids and gases are. We have them around us every day. 

				<h5>Let's look at Plasma...</h5>
				
				Plasma is not a common state of matter here on Earth, but it may be the most common state of matter in the universe, according to the Jefferson Laboratory. Stars are essentially superheated balls of plasma. 


				Plasma consists of highly charged particles with extremely high kinetic energy. The noble gases (helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon and radon) are often used to make glowing signs by using electricity to ionize them to the plasma state. 

				<h5>Bose-Einstein condensate</h5>

				The Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) was created by scientists in 1995. Using a combination of lasers and magnets, Eric Cornell and Carl Weiman, scientists at the Joint Institute for Lab Astrophysics (JILA) in Boulder, Colorado, cooled a sample of rubidium to within a few degrees of absolute zero. At this extremely low temperature, molecular motion comes very close to stopping. Since there is almost no kinetic energy being transferred from one atom to another, the atoms begin to clump together. There are no longer thousands of separate atoms, just one "super atom." 


				A BEC is used to study quantum mechanics on a macroscopic level. Light appears to slow down as it passes through a BEC, allowing scientists to study the particle/wave paradox. A BEC also has many of the properties of a superfluid, or a fluid that flows without friction. BECs are also used to simulate conditions that might exist in black holes.

			<h2>Quantum Computing</h2>
			<h3>October 23, 2020</h3>

			<p>
				Quantum computers perform calculations based on the probability of an object's state before it is measured - instead of just 1s or 0s - which means they have the potential to process exponentially more data compared to classical computers.


				Classical computers carry out logical operations using the definite position of a physical state. These are usually binary, meaning its operations are based on one of two positions. A single state - such as on or off, up or down, 1 or 0 - is called a bit.


				In quantum computing, operations instead use the quantum state of an object to produce what's known as a qubit. These states are the undefined properties of an object before they've been detected, such as the spin of an electron or the polarisation of a photon.


				Rather than having a clear position, unmeasured quantum states occur in a mixed 'superposition', not unlike a coin spinning through the air before it lands in your hand.


				These superpositions can be entangled with those of other objects, meaning their final outcomes will be mathematically related even if we don't know yet what they are.


				The complex mathematics behind these unsettled states of entangled 'spinning coins' can be plugged into special algorithms to make short work of problems that would take a classical computer a long time to work out... if they could ever calculate them at all.


				Such algorithms would be useful in solving complex mathematical problems, producing hard-to-break security codes, or predicting multiple particle interactions in chemical reactions.

			<h2>Blockchain</h2>
			<h3>October 30, 2020</h3>

			<p>
				Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system.


				A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain. Each block in the chain contains a number of transactions, and every time a new transaction occurs on the blockchain, a record of that transaction is added to every participant’s ledger. The decentralised database managed by multiple participants is known as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).


				Blockchain is a type of DLT in which transactions are recorded with an immutable cryptographic signature called a hash.


				This means if one block in one chain was changed, it would be immediately apparent it had been tampered with. If hackers wanted to corrupt a blockchain system, they would have to change every block in the chain, across all of the distributed versions of the chain.


				Blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are constantly and continually growing as blocks are being added to the chain, which significantly adds to the security of the ledger.

			<h2>What is Dark Energy?</h2>
			<h3>November 6, 2020</h3>

			<p>
				More is unknown than is known. We know how much dark energy there is because we know how it affects the universe's expansion. Other than that, it is a complete mystery. But it is an important mystery. It turns out that roughly 68% of the universe is dark energy. Dark matter makes up about 27%. The rest - everything on Earth, everything ever observed with all of our instruments, all normal matter - adds up to less than 5% of the universe. Come to think of it, maybe it shouldn't be called "normal" matter at all, since it is such a small fraction of the universe.


				One explanation for dark energy is that it is a property of space. Albert Einstein was the first person to realize that empty space is not nothing. Space has amazing properties, many of which are just beginning to be understood. The first property that Einstein discovered is that it is possible for more space to come into existence. Then one version of Einstein's gravity theory, the version that contains a cosmological constant, makes a second prediction: "empty space" can possess its own energy. Because this energy is a property of space itself, it would not be diluted as space expands. As more space comes into existence, more of this energy-of-space would appear. As a result, this form of energy would cause the universe to expand faster and faster. Unfortunately, no one understands why the cosmological constant should even be there, much less why it would have exactly the right value to cause the observed acceleration of the universe. 


				Another explanation for how space acquires energy comes from the quantum theory of matter. In this theory, "empty space" is actually full of temporary ("virtual") particles that continually form and then disappear. But when physicists tried to calculate how much energy this would give empty space, the answer came out wrong - wrong by a lot. The number came out 10120 times too big. That's a 1 with 120 zeros after it. It's hard to get an answer that bad. So the mystery continues.


				Another explanation for dark energy is that it is a new kind of dynamical energy fluid or field, something that fills all of space but something whose effect on the expansion of the universe is the opposite of that of matter and normal energy. Some theorists have named this "quintessence," after the fifth element of the Greek philosophers. But, if quintessence is the answer, we still don't know what it is like, what it interacts with, or why it exists. So the mystery continues.


				A last possibility is that Einstein's theory of gravity is not correct. That would not only affect the expansion of the universe, but it would also affect the way that normal matter in galaxies and clusters of galaxies behaved. This fact would provide a way to decide if the solution to the dark energy problem is a new gravity theory or not: we could observe how galaxies come together in clusters. But if it does turn out that a new theory of gravity is needed, what kind of theory would it be? How could it correctly describe the motion of the bodies in the Solar System, as Einstein's theory is known to do, and still give us the different prediction for the universe that we need? There are candidate theories, but none are compelling. So the mystery continues.


				The thing that is needed to decide between dark energy possibilities - a property of space, a new dynamic fluid, or a new theory of gravity - is more data, better data.

			<h2>What is Dark Matter?</h2>
			<h3>November 13, 2020</h3>

			<p>
				By fitting a theoretical model of the composition of the universe to the combined set of cosmological observations, scientists have come up with the composition that we described above, ~68% dark energy, ~27% dark matter, ~5% normal matter. What is dark matter?


				We are much more certain what dark matter is not than we are what it is. First, it is dark, meaning that it is not in the form of stars and planets that we see. Observations show that there is far too little visible matter in the universe to make up the 27% required by the observations. Second, it is not in the form of dark clouds of normal matter, matter made up of particles called baryons. We know this because we would be able to detect baryonic clouds by their absorption of radiation passing through them. Third, dark matter is not antimatter, because we do not see the unique gamma rays that are produced when antimatter annihilates with matter. Finally, we can rule out large galaxy-sized black holes on the basis of how many gravitational lenses we see. High concentrations of matter bend light passing near them from objects further away, but we do not see enough lensing events to suggest that such objects to make up the required 25% dark matter contribution.


				However, at this point, there are still a few dark matter possibilities that are viable. Baryonic matter could still make up the dark matter if it were all tied up in brown dwarfs or in small, dense chunks of heavy elements. These possibilities are known as massive compact halo objects, or "MACHOs". But the most common view is that dark matter is not baryonic at all, but that it is made up of other, more exotic particles like axions or WIMPS (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles).

			<h2>Superfluidity</h2>
			<h3>November 20, 2020</h3>

			<p>
				Superfluidity is the odd property of a liquid in which it has zero-resistance for flow, and thus flows without loss of kinetic energy. The most common isotope of helium, helium-4, shows superfluidity near absolute zero temperature (less than -270 degrees Celsius). While it has been the subject of extensive study, the details of the microscopic state, including dynamic atom-atom correlations in the superfluid state, are not fully understood. Furthermore, because the atoms are strongly correlated in liquid, the description of its local dynamics is challenging.


				Using inelastic neutron scattering, researchers identified the real-space mechanism of flow. Typically, the inelastic neutron scattering data are presented in the momentum and energy space. However, to be more informative, a team led by researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory transformed the data to real space in the form of the dynamic pair-density function. Researchers carried out a detailed analysis of the neutron scattering data to determine the length scale and the energy scale of the real-space mechanism of the superfluid. A new spectral peak was discovered and is explained as coherent atomic tunneling. This coherent tunneling of helium-4 atoms provides evidence of a real-space mechanism of superfluid flow. This conclusion provides the key to understanding the atomistic mechanism of flow in superfluids.

			<h2>A perpetual force of mystery</h2>
			<h3>November 27, 2020</h3>

			<p>
				Gravity perplexes scientists in other ways, too. The Standard Model of particle physics, which describes the actions of almost all known particles and forces, leaves out gravity. While light is carried by a particle called a photon, physicists have no idea if there is an equivalent particle for gravity, which would be called a graviton. 


				Bringing gravity together in a theoretical framework with quantum mechanics, the other major discovery of the 20th-century physics community, remains an unfinished task. Such a theory of everything, as it’s known, might never be realized. 


				But gravity has still been used to uncover monumental findings. In the 1960s and 70s, astronomers Vera Rubin and Kent Ford showed that stars at the edges of galaxies were orbiting faster than should be possible. It was almost as if some unseen mass was tugging on them gravitationally, bringing to light a material that we now call dark matter. 


				In recent years, scientists have also managed to capture another consequence of Einstein’s relativity — gravitational waves emitted when massive objects like neutron stars and black holes rotate around one another. Since 2017, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) has opened up a new window to the universe by detecting the exceedingly faint signal of such events.
