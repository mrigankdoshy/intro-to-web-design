      <h2>Fractals</h2>
      <h3>September 11, 2020</h3>

        Fractals are one of the world’s most amazing mathematical concepts. They can be observed in nature and even within ourselves.

        Why does a river sometimes look like a tree that looks like a leaf? Why is a snowflake the way it is? “In the whole of science, the whole of mathematics, smoothness was everything. What I did was to open up roughness for investigation,” Mandelbrot said. Why? Cloud aren't perfect spheres and mountains aren't cones. There is some irregularity, some asymmetry in the universe.

        A fractal is a never-ending pattern. They are infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales. They are driven by recursion - repeating a simple process over and over again. Fractals are images of dynamic systems – the pictures of Chaos.

              <h4>Mandelbrot Set</h4>

              <p>
                This fractal is named after mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot, who in 1975 first proposed the term “fractal”.

                Each of these crowns consists of similar "seahorse tails"; their number increases with powers of 2, a typical phenomenon in the environment of satellites. The unique path to the spiral center passes the satellite from the groove of the cardioid to the top of the "antenna" on the "head".

      <h2>Golden Ratio</h2>
      <h3>September 18, 2020</h3>

      <p>
        A couple of centuries ago, some of the greatest minds started observing patterns in the beautiful nature around themselves; From the pattern of the florets of a flower, to the leaf arrangement in plants, the scales of a pineapple or the bracts of a pinecone; everything had the same pattern. And the arrangement goes 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 and so on. That's right, it's the Fibonacci sequence. When you start calculating ratio of fibonacci number with its previous fibonacci number, we end up with something like 1.61803... an irrational number.

         The Golden Ratio describes the perfectly symmetrical relationship between two proportions. Approximately equal to a 1:1.618 ratio, the Golden Ratio can be illustrated using a Golden Rectangle. This is a rectangle where, if you cut off a square (side length equal to the shortest side of the rectangle), the rectangle that's left will have the same proportions as the original rectangle.

         So if you remove the left-hand square from the rectangle above, you'll be left with another, smaller Golden Rectangle. This could continue infinitely. Similarly, adding a square equal to the length of the longest side of the rectangle gets you increasingly closer to a Golden Rectangle and the Golden Ratio.

         This relates to the Fibonacci Sequence (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...) , in which each term is the sum of the previous two. 

         <p><img src="goldenspiral.jpg" width="500" height="333"/></p>

         Plotting the relationships in scale provides us with what's know as a Golden Spiral. This occurs organically in the natural world. Mathematically golden ratio is an irrational number, which means we can never achieve it perfectly in design; a debate going on forever.

      <h2>The Creation of the Destroyer</h2>
      <h3>September 25, 2020</h3>

      <p>Have you ever wondered about the creation of a black hole? A black hole is, to put in layman terms, the death of a star. A star lives off its life emitting light in the form of solar radiation for about billions of years untill a time comes when the fuel finishes and the internal gravitational force of the star dominates causing it to shrink and increasing its density so much that it bends the space time. The trough in the space time is so huge that any object near it would sink and fall towards the black hole.</p>
